# Arduino library for Ubiquiti mPower pro switches

This project enables an Arduino to control a IP power switch. The library is able to read the status of the switches (enabled or disabled, currently used power and power factor) and to set the output ports. See the example for more details.
The library is also able to set the default relais status after power up of the device.
