# GoProControl
This is a library to interface with GoPro camera

## Supported boards/camera:
- ESP8266 or ESP32
- any arduino boards (UNO, nano, 101, etc.) attached to an ESP8266 (ESP01) using this library https://github.com/bportaluri/WiFiEsp

For now I just added my camera (HERO3+) but I made the library with a style which would be quite easy to add other cameras. I will be very happy to accept pull requests and have as collaborator other people

## Installation

Use the arduino library manager

## Reference

for more information see here: https://www.hackster.io/vincenzo-g/goprocontrol-arduino-9083e2

all the commands came from: https://github.com/KonradIT/goprowifihack

The idea cames from another gopro library: https://github.com/agdl/GoPRO which works only on arduino WiFi boards and only with gopro HERO3.
